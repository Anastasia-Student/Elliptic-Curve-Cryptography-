# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
In this lab, I implemented arithmetic on elliptic curves in projective coordinates (see my_library.py):
- functions for checking whether a point belongs to a curve;
- adding points;
- doubling point;
- scalar product;
- functions of transformation of a point between affine and projective coordinates.

To check the execution of the program, the parameters of the elliptical R-224 were taken.
